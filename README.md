## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptology-playground.git
cd cryptology-playground
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Windows OS: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-build-isolation python-camellia (install camellia separately, because of deprecated version)
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python3.10 mainwindow.py
```

---

## Run using Docker

### 1. Make sure you have docker installed

Follow the official guide to install Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### 2. Build the Docker image

```bash
sudo docker build -t cryptology_playground_app .
```

### 3. Create a shared output folder on your host
This will let you access files generated by the app (e.g., keys, certificates):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/cryptology_playground_app-output
```

In Windows systems:
```bash
mkdir C:\cryptology_playground_app-output
```

### 4. Run the application with GUI support
These instructions are for Linux systems using X11 (like Ubuntu). Ensure xhost access is granted:

```bash
xhost +local:docker
docker run -it \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -v ~/cryptology_playground_app-output:/root/Downloads \
  cryptology_playground_app
```

In Windows systems:
```bash
docker run -it ^
  -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0 ^
  -v C:\cryptology_playground_app-output:/root/Downloads ^
  cryptology_playground_app
```

### 5. Accessing Output Files
All files saved by the application (such as keys or certificates) will be stored under:

```bash
~/cryptology_playground_app-output
```

In Windows systems, check under:
```bash
C:\cryptology_playground_app-output
```
