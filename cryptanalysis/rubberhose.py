        "<li>A deniable encryption system allows the same encrypted data to be decrypted into different plaintexts depending on the key used.</li>"
        "<li>If forced to reveal a key, the user can provide a decoy key that decrypts to harmless data, making it impossible to prove whether additional hidden data exists.</li>"
        "<li>Systems like <b>VeraCryptâ€™s hidden volumes</b> allow users to store sensitive files inside an encrypted container that itself contains a visible, less important set of files.</li>"
        "<li>Even if coerced to provide a password, the user can reveal only the decoy container while keeping the true hidden volume secret.</li>"
        "<li>Some deniable encryption schemes are used in secure messaging protocols to ensure that even if a user is forced to decrypt a message, they can plausibly claim that the decrypted text was the only message.</li>"
