        "Linear cryptanalysis was discovered by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuru_Matsui'>Mitsuru Matsui</a> "
        "in 1992 and was successfully used to attack the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard'>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</a>. <br>"
        "Linear cryptanalysis exploits statistical biases in the linear approximations of the cipherâ€™s operations. It relies "
        "on finding linear relationships between plaintext bits, ciphertext bits, and key bits that hold with a probability "
        "significantly different from 50%. These biases allow an attacker to deduce information about the secret key after "
        "analyzing a large number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs. <br><br>"
