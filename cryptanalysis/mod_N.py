               "RC5 operates on 32-bit words (or 16/64 bit words) and relies on modular addition, xor operation, and left rotation. An attacker can exploit the "
               "structure of modular addition for cryptanalysis."

               "However, before rotation, modular addition introduces carry bits that may leak information. A cryptanalyst might exploit how carry propagation behaves under mod 2<sup>w</sup> "
               "(where w is the word size/bits).</p>"
               "<p>If two plaintexts differ by a multiple of 2<sup>w</sup>, their encryption outputs might reveal a pattern. By choosing plaintext pairs where differences cancel out modulo "
               "2<sup>w</sup>, an attacker can detect when a carry occurs, reducing key search space. If we analyze modular addition carry propagation, we can find differential pairs that "
